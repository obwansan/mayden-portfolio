            <p>I am currently a trainee full-stack Web developer at Mayden Academy in Bath.
                Before starting the course I worked for 10 years as a Technical Writer and
                documentation Project Manager at various companies, including Visa and Nokia.</p>
            <p>My interest in Web development was first piqued when I looked into creating my
                own website for freelance technical writing work. I quickly discovered a wealth
                of online tutorials and resources and found that I was really enjoying learning
                to code and create websites. I realised I wanted to make a career change into Web
                development and continued studying in my spare time before applying to Mayden Academy.</p>
            <p>I love both the analytical, problem-solving side of coding, and the more creative
                aspects of Web design. UI/UX also interests me greatly as technical writing taught
                me to focus on the end-user experience. I am looking forward to getting my first job
                as a Web developer, deepening and expanding my skill set and getting more involved in
                the Bath/Bristol tech community.</p>
